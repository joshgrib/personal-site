# personal-site

![CI](https://github.com/joshgrib/personal-site/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

The repo for a new personal website

Current hosted [on firebase](https://josh-software.web.app/), but after some DNS updates this should drive [josh.software](http://josh.software/)

I'm going to make the site itself with [alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) and [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), but then it might link out to or host some other projects written in different languages. These are both projects I've been interested in for a while but haven't used for anything sizable. Additionally, I've been doing a lot of stuff involving a build step recently so I want to keep this super simple and go with all static files, at least in the beginning.
