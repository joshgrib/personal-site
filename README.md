# personal-site

![CI](https://github.com/joshgrib/personal-site/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

The repo for a new personal website - [josh.software](https://josh.software/)

* Hosted on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
* Deployed with [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
* Styling with [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* UI with [alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine)

I've used Firebase before but the other stuff was all new to me and I've been wanting to use them for a while. I've also been doing a lot of stuff with a build step so I wanted to make this all with static files.

## TODO:

- [x] Set up basic site
- [ ] Create some sort of summary/intro thing
- [ ] Display projects better, ideally with some images and links to demos
